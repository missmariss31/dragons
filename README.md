# Dragon website built with bootstrap
## Dragon memory game built with canvas and javascript

This is a work in progress.  My 13 yr old daughter drew some dragons and wanted to start a business selling her artwork.  The website links to her cafepress shirts and stuff (hope that's not a problem on here.)  I'm working on building a dragon memory game to include on the website.

I may use this as my final project submission for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Javascript course.
